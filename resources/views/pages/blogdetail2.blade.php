										<p>Los Angeles is one of the most sought-after holiday destinations that feature
											in the travel list of many tourists. From the beaches of Santa Monica to its
											shopping districts of Rodeo Drive, the city has so much to offer. You could
											be surfing on the beaches in the morning and gazing at the stars in the
											Griffith Observatory by the evening, and there’s just so much to experience
											here. Which is why it was a bewildering time for us to squeeze all these
											sightseeing attractions into just three days. But we did our best.</p>
										<p>Here’s a comprehensive guide for fellow travel enthusiasts looking for a
											short trip to Los Angeles.</p>
										<p><b>THINGS TO DO:</b></p>
										<p>Start your trip by visiting the widely popular Runyon Canyon Park sprawled
											across 160 acres of land. If you are an adventure junkie, this is where you
											can enjoy scenic hiking trails. It is a great place to view the Hollywood
											Sign ( in the distance ). The trails are not very long and doable for all
											levels. It should not take you more than 2 hours for the longest trail and
											you will get lots of sweeping views. The park is also officially a dog park
											so you can find plenty of furry friends running around free.</p>
										<p>If you are travelling with your kids, score some brownie points by taking
											them to the Universal Studios Hollywood. From classic movie sets to
											immersive experiences like Jurassic Park and Harry Potter, there’s much fun
											to be had here.</p>
										<p>Your trip to Los Angeles is incomplete without clicking pictures of your
											favourite stars at the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The complete walk runs for
											about 1.3 miles in total and is home to more than 2,600 brass and terrazzo
											stars.</p>
										<p>End your day star gazing from the Griffith Observatory. The vista from the
											hilltop is spectacular at the nights with the entire city twinkling below in
											bright lights.</p>
										<p>Visit one of the most iconic landmarks of Los Angeles, Santa Monica Pier,
											which is home to Santa Monica Pier Aquarium, amusement parks, movie
											screenings, concerts and much more. It is also where the historic road 66
											ends, that crooses 8 states with the starting point in Chicago.</p>
										<p>On a hillside above Brentwood, the Getty Center is another famous attraction
											that draws a lot of crowds. The museum is known to leave its visitors
											speechless with its architectural brilliance and jaw-dropping exhibitions.
										</p>
										<p>End your day with the magnificent Sunset Boulevard, an epic thoroughfare of
											Los Angeles. The street is 22 miles long with the most famous part of it
											being The Sunset Strip. The palm-lined street is world-famous for its
											cinematic appeal and nightlife scenes.</p>
