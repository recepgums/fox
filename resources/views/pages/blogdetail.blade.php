                                <p>AeroMexico, what to say, I was shocked reading all those not good reviews
                                    about the company, after we purchased a holiday package, with AeroMexico
                                    being the airline flying us to and from Mexico. </p>
                                <p>The rating on Trustpilot 1.9*, TripAdvisor is a little higher 3.5* and all
                                    those comments, in addition, about very rude flight attendants, horrible
                                    service onboard, lost luggage, stolen items from your baggage, etc.
                                    Honestly, it was quite hard to find a comment of a satisfied customer. </p>
                                <p>We didn’t want to spend more money and rebook our flight with another
                                    company, so we gave it a go. </p>
                                <p><b>A return flight from London Heathrow to Cancun with a stop in Mexico City.
                                    </b></p>
                                <p>After reading all those negative reviews, we decided to prep for the flight.
                                    We had an economy class tickets that included 2 carry-on items both up to 10
                                    kg and checked baggage up to 23kg, that we thought was good for the company
                                    with an average rating being approx 2.7*. </p>
                                <p>So, we divided all our items and took all valuables and some clothes on board
                                    in the carry on luggage, we also, wrapped our baggage at the airport, hoping
                                    our stuff arrives in Cancun with us.</p>
                                <p>We boarded the plane and the first impression was very good. A new, modern
                                    plane, looked tidy, a smiling flight attendant welcomes you onboard. </p>
                                <p>Honestly, what’s going on, it’s not what I prepared myself for. </p>
                                <p>The second flight was also great, although, the plane was pretty old, I don’t
                                    think I’ve ever flown on a such an old plane, but, anyway, they were serving
                                    some snakes and free drinks which is great. We were also happy to see our
                                    baggage in Cancun safe and sound. </p>
                                <p>On the way back, the flight from Cancun to Mexico City was good and the plane
                                    was new this time. But, in Mexico City, we found out that our flight to
                                    London was five and a half hours delayed. At the information desk, we
                                    received vouchers for a free meal, had late dinner and just waited for the
                                    flight. </p>
                                <p>To sum up, we obviously weren’t happy with all the delays thing, who would
                                    be, but we didn’t see or experienced anything bad on our 4 flights with the
                                    company. The service was nice, seats were comfortable, we had enough of
                                    legroom, friendly staff, the flight entertainment was good, the internet was
                                    available onboard for an extra price, but anyone could use WhatsApp or
                                    Messenger for texts free of charge. </p>
                                <p>We would rate the overall experience 4.5* out of 5. Taking 0.5 for delays.
                                </p>
